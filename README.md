de.prauscher.cli
================

this package provides a simple to use command line interpreter for Java.
It works by adding annotations to methods, which are then called
by the CLI.

It is also capable of passing and casting arguments from the UI to the
methods and provides a basic system to list available commands and
give brief explanations.

You find examples beneath "rsc".
